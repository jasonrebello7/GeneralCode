This program records a video from a webcam and then splits the video into frames.

Records several videos by changing the name. Videos are saved as
Temp1.avi
Temp2.avi
Temp3.avi .. etc.

The second part of the program reads in each .avi file and splits the videos into frames and stores it in respective folders e.g.
Temp1/1Temp1.jpg
Temp1/2Temp1.jpg
Temp1/3Temp1.jpg .. for the first video

Temp2/1Temp2.jpg
Temp2/2Temp2.jpg
Temp2/3Temp2.jpg .. for the second video etc.

Motivation : I could record the video on my mac however I had trouble converting the compressed avi format to an uncompressed format. The .jpg's were then used in matlab for image processing.
